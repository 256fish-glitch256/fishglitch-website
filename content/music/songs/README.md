# How to Add Music Files

To add your music to the music player:

1. Place your audio files (MP3, WAV, or OGG format) in this `songs/` directory
2. The files will automatically appear on the music page
3. File names will be converted to titles (underscores and hyphens become spaces)

Example:
- `my-awesome-song.mp3` → "🎵 my awesome song"
- `track_01.wav` → "🎵 track 01"

The music player page is available at `/music/`
