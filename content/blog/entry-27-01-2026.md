# Last year I joined the Thinkpad club

And it's because of my work computer. There's something about these laptops that you can't describe. Maybe it's the iconic looks? Maybe it's the small size and the big capabilities?

# My devices
Anyways in the process I got myself 2 of them - one at the beginning of the year and the other at the end of it.
I sold the first one because my friend's computer broke and I didn't want to leave them without one. 
So I got myself another, smaller one. 

It's a T14 Gen 1. It's a used one of course and has some case imperfections, but it works!! And is really fun to use!
Though I have no idea what people do with their computers where they get case damage as a result. Throw them at the wall or what??

Anyways - it has some Linux installed, like it should, and I keep having so much fun with it. It's Fedora with GNOME.
I know that many people despise GNOME, and so did I. I came back to it after a few years and now I can't use anything else.
After a while I tried KDE but it was so confusing to theme for me that I came back to GNOME again.

It's very ironic to me that after having used both Windows and MacOS I actually like using Linux the most. 
It has the most logical keyboard shortcuts surprisingly Windows being the second. MacOS has very weird controls and keyboard shortcuts are even more confusing.
